BamazoN
---

*BamazoN is a store front, using node and MySql to create a user interface for both the customer and manager. 
---

**What can BamazoN do ?**

All you need to know:

BamazoN will run as two primary users, the customer and the manager.

---

**As a customer**, you are able to view all of the stock and item information, choosing which item to purchase, total cost and stock available.

---

**As a manager**, you are able to work with a menu system to either view inventory, view stock running low, add new stock to the inventory and add new items to the "shop floor".


---
**All of these experiences have been created with a good user experience in mind, and constant validation checks to ensure user input and backend reliability. **




**BeamazoN also uses several packages:**
